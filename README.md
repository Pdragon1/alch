# Alchemy EVM JS SDK

This is a prototype for Alchemy's JS SDK for EVM-based chains.

The goal is to create a lightweight, modular SDK that encapsulates common usage patterns and abstracts away the
complexities of the HTTP endpoints. To start, we're trying to create feature parity with the existing `alchemy-web3`
library. From there, we'll add additional features and higher level abstractions.

## Getting started

The SDK is currently packaged in the repository as a tarball file. To install, copy the `alchemy-evm-js-1.0.0.tgz`
file in this repo into your project's root directory and run:

```
npm install alchemy-evm-js-1.0.0.tgz
```

After installing the app, you can then import and use the SDK:

```ts
import { AlchemyConfig, Network, initializeAlchemy } from 'alchemy-evm-js';

// Optional Config object, but defaults to demo api-key and eth-mainnet.
const settings = {
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  network: Network.ETH_RINKEBY,
  maxRetries: 10
};

const alchemy = initializeAlchemy(settings);
```

The SDK's modular approach exports all functions at the top-level to reduce bundle size (only the functions you import and use will be included). This means you access each method like: 

```ts
// Initializing the alchemy config object
import { initializeAlchemy } from 'alchemy-evm-js';

const alchemy = initializeAlchemy(); // using default settings - pass in a settings object to specify your API key and network

// Get all NFTs for a given owner
import { getNFTs } from 'alchemy-evm-js';

getNfts(alchemy, { onwer: '0xABC' });
```

However, this can make it harder to discover the full API surface. If you want your IDE to find all functions, you can import
the entire SDK:

```ts
import * as alchemySdk from 'alchemy-evm-js';

const alchemy = alchemySdk.initializeAlchemy();
alchemySdk.getNftsForOwner(alchemy, { owner: '0x123' });
```

## SDK Structure

The `Alchemy` object returned by `initializeAlchemy()` is an object that holds configuration settings. An optional
config object can be passed in when initializing to set a custom API key, change the network, or specify the max number
of retries. The object can then be passed into other top-level functions like `getNftsForOwner()` or `getAssetTransfers()`.
The current supported functions using this pattern are the NFT API endpoints and Alchemy Enhanced APIs.

## Ethers.js for for JSON-RPC Calls

The `Alchemy.getProvider()` function configures the
Ethers.js [AlchemyProvider](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/api-providers/#AlchemyProvider) and returns it. This
allows you to perform  core json-rpc calls with an Alchemy provider, just as you normally would with Ethers. So if you are already using Ethers, you can simply use the provider from `alchemy-evm-js` and the rest of your code should just work:

```ts
const alchemy = alchemySdk.initializeAlchemy();

// ETH JSON-RPC calls through ethers.js Provider
const ethersAlchemyProvider = alchemy.getProvider();
ethersAlchemyProvider.getBalance('0xABC...', 'latest').then(console.log);
```

## NFT Module

The SDK currently supports the following NFT endpoints:

- `getNftMetadata()`: Gets the NFT metadata for a contract address and tokenId.
- `getNftsForOwner()`: Get NFTs for an owner address.
- `getNftsForOwnerIterator()`: Get NFTs for an owner address as an async iterator.
- `getNftsForCollection()`: Gets all NFTs for a contract address.
- `getNftForCollectionIterator()`: Gets all NFTs for a contract address as an async iterator.
- `getOwnersForNft()`: Get all the owners for a given NFT contract address and token ID.
- `checkNftOwnership()`: Checks that the provided owner address owns one or more of the provided NFT contract addresses.
- `findContractDeployer()`: Finds the contract deployer and block number for a given NFT contract address.
- `refreshNftMetadata()`: Refreshes the cached NFT metadata for a contract address and tokenId.

### Comparing `BaseNft` and `Nft`

The SDK currently uses `BaseNft` and `Nft` classes to represent NFTs returned by the Alchemy. The `BaseNft` object does
not hold any metadata information and only contains the NFT contract and token ID. The `Nft` object additionally
contains the NFT metadata, token URI information, and media.

By default, the SDK will return the `Nft` object. You can optionally choose to fetch the `BaseNft` object instead by
setting the `omitMetadata` parameter to `true`. The documentation describes the different parameter and response
interfaces in more detail.

### Pagination

The Alchemy endpoints return 100 NFTs per page. To get the next page, you can pass in the `pageKey` returned by the
previous call. To simplify paginating through all NFTs, the SDK provides `getNftsIterator()`
and `getNftsForCollectionIterator()` functions that automatically paginate through all NFTs and yields them via
an `AsyncIterable`.

Here's an example of how to paginate through all the NFTs in Vitalik's ENS address:

```ts
import { getNftsForOwnerIterator } from './nft-api';

async function main() {
  const ownerAddress = 'vitalik.eth';
  for await (const nft of getNftsForOwnerIterator(alchemy, ownerAddress)) {
    console.log('ownedNft:', nft);
  }
}

main();
```

### API Differences

The NFT API in the SDK standardizes response types to reduce developer friction, but note this results in some
differences with the Alchemy REST endpoints:

- Some methods have different naming that the REST API counterparts in order to provide a consistent API interface (
  e.g. `getNftsForOwner()` is `alchemy_getNfts`, `getOwnersForNft()` is `alchemy_getOwnersForToken`).
- SDK standardizes to `omitMetadata` parameter (vs. `withMetadata`).
- Standardization to `pageKey` parameter for pagination (vs. `nextToken`/`startToken`)
- Empty `TokenUri` fields are omitted.
- Token ID is always normalized to an integer string on `BaseNft` and `Nft.
- Some fields omitted in the REST response are included in the SDK response in order to return an `Nft` object.
- Some fields in the SDK's `Nft` object are named differently than the REST response.

## Documentation

The SDK is documented via `tsdoc` comments in the source code. The generated types and documentation are included when
using an IDE. To browse the documentation separately, you can view the generated API interfaces
in `etc/alchemy-evm-js.api.md`. You can view generated Markdown files for each endpoint in the `docs-md` directory,
or as a webpage by opening `docs/index.html` in your browser.

## Future Work

There's a long list, but here are the main ones:

- Websocket support
- Retry count support for json-rpc calls (currently only HTTP calls are retried)
- More config options for the base ethers.js AlchemyProvider.
- Most of these changes require extending the base ethers.js SDK with custom implementations.
- Separating SDK into separate packages.

## Examples

Below are a few usage examples:

Getting the NFTs owned by an address
```ts
// Get how many NFTs an address owns
import { getNfts, getNftsIterator } from 'alchemy-evm-js';

getNfts(alchemy, {
    owner: '0xshah.eth'
}).then(nfts => {
    console.log(nfts.totalCount);
});

//Get all the image urls for all the NFTs an address owns
for await (const nft of getNftsIterator(alchemy, {
    owner: '0xshah.eth'
})) {
    console.log(nft.media);
}
```

Getting the transfer history of an NFT
```ts
import { getAssetTransfersIterator } from 'alchemy-evm-js';

const transfer_history = [];
for await (const txn of getAssetTransfersIterator(alchemy, {
  fromAddress: '0x0',
  contractAddress: '0xABC',
  category: 'token'
})) {
  transfer_history.pust(txn); 
}
console.log(transfer_history);
```

Get all the NFTs someone has ever received
```ts
import { getAssetTransfers, AssetTransfersCategory } from 'alchemy-evm-js';

getAssetTransfers(alchemy, {
    fromBlock: '0x0',
    toAddress: '0x994b342Dd87fc825F66E51FfA3EF71aD818B6893',
    category: [AssetTransfersCategory.TOKEN]
}).then(resp => {
    for (const transfer of resp.transfers) {
        console.log(transfer);
    }
});
```
